ðŸš€ Thrilled to announce the launch of Assistants Hub (https://assistantshub.ai), my latest open-source project that's been in the works since early January! ðŸŒŸ It's a user-friendly portal designed to empower everyone to create and integrate AI assistants (powered by OpenAI's technology) into their websites or apps in just minutes.

The journey ahead is filled with exciting plans and I can't wait to explore them! âœ¨ If you're passionate about AI and want to contribute, I'd love to hear from you. Let's innovate together! #OpenSource #AI #Innovation #TechCommunity #openaiproducts #openai #github #samaltman
